Developed by [Javier Wasserman](https://www.javierwasserman.com)

## Description

Basically we believe business cards are such an obsolete technology.
So, there should be an quicker and less obsolete way to share personal information. Hello to QIQR

There is a QR generator and also a vcard generator, even with Nextjs on Vercel, uploading to an S3 bucket.
